			Secure Delete
			
			by Techienethead


Secure delete is a program that calls on the Shred function within debian
based systems.The idea behind Secure Delete is to fully overwrite the file
by replacing it with warped characters and finally by 0's, then reducing 
those 0's until there is nothing left. It is a far better way of deleting 
content. The reason is a simple delete still means that through forensics, 
the file can be recovered. Using a secure delete method will ensure forensics 
cannot see the file.

Thank you for choosing Secure Delete.
